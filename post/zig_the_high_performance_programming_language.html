        Zig is often given the label that it is the alternative to C,
        <b>"the next generation of C".</b>

        The creator of zig is
        <a href="https://github.com/andrewrk" target="_blank">"Andrew Kelly"</a>
        its first version was released in 2016 and has evolved exponentially to
        become one of the most desired languages in the world.

          The zig programming language has attributes that make it a very
          attractive development tool.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>✅ Minimalist</li>
          <li>✅ Extremely fast</li>
          <li>✅ Low level memory control</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Zig, rather than managing memory directly, uses a function found in
          the standard library including allocators to provide a consistent
          interface for memory management. Zig is not a memory-safe language
          like Rust or Go, but it is not. It has no hidden memory allocations,
          which makes the code much more explicit and portable, because memory
          allocators can be easily swapped in the code to target different
          architectures, e.g. X86 ARM web assembly.

          Therefore zig does not have a hidden control flow, if a function
          appears it is a function, there is no operator overloading and it does
          not even have exceptions, if a function fails it needs to return an
          explicit error value. The language also has a unique compile-time
          keyword that makes it important to run it at compile time. Zig
          requires no preprocessors or macros, and finally, zig can integrate
          well into a C or C++ codebase that supports cross-computation out of
          the box with LLVM.

        <h2>Use Zig</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          You must download the official version of Zig, on its
          <a href="https://ziglang.org/" target="_blank">website.</a> then
          create a new project with <code>zig init-exe</code> command.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the main file the <code>std</code> standard library is first
          imported and then a <code>main</code> function is defined. It details
          how the function returns a <code>!void</code>, an empty type with an
          exclamation point, that sign means the function may return an error.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-zig">
          const std = @import("std");
          
          pub fn main() !void {
              std.debug.print("Hello {s}\n", .{"World"});
          }
          </code></pre>
        <br />

        <p>
          Zig has more functionalities and I fell short in this post, but for
          more information and if you are interested in knowing more about zig,
          you can visit its
          <a href="https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/" target="_blank"
            >learnig page</a
          >
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          Zig also has communities in both Spanish and English, the latter being
          the largest.
